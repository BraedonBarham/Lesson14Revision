            Global oil demand is expected to increase, and U.S. production has followed similarly.
            In order to support future oil demand, the U.S. must keep increasing oil production, otherwise the nation's consumers will be paying higher prices for harder to access oil.

        <p>
            Shale is easy and cheap to access oil, but top performing shale fields are declining in quantity. Because shale wells fall in production quickly,
            new wells must continuously be drilled. Because fewer quality shale fields are avaible, a larger quantity of wells will have to be drilled on poorer quality land,
            driving up required investment costs just to keep total U.S. proudction levels flat.

        </div>

        <p>
            DUCs - Drilled but Uncomplete Wells, are oil wells that have been drilled, but don't yet produce any oil because they haven't been completed.
            They're very important for oil producers and the U.S. because they serve as a quick way to create oil production and thus smooth out oil market supply shocks.
            DUC supply being low is a real problem because it introduces the possibility of price stability which is a national concern.
            In order to support the U.S. consumer base reliably, the number of DUCs need to increase, requiring increased investments from recent years to make up for the shortfall in supply.

            Why a website?
        </h4>
        <p>
        My point in revising my essay to a webpage format is simple. 
        I know basic web development, and I thought making a basic website would be a cool way to demonstrate my revision.
        I also didn't require many pictures for my revision, so making a visual or short video wouldn't be preferrable.
        So instead, I made a text-heavy, but picture supported website where the important points were in small chunks with a few photos to help demonstrate them.
        Also because I could easily integrate it into the project itself.
        The audience I'd like to reach is people who learn best by reading information and would like to know basic reasons for supporting the U.S. oil industry.
        I dislike oil as much as anybody else does, but I find it extremely important to understand the role it plays in our lives.
